        Welcome to my portfolio page! My name is Alex Marmolejo. I am a
        self-taught Full-Stack Javascript Developer based in New York. My skill
        set includes the MERN stack and "T3 stack". With these skills, I am able
        to build functional and visually appealing full-stack web applications
        with attention to detail.

        My educational background in accounting, finance, and taxes, allows me
        to bring a unique perspective to web development in these industries.
        Although I am capable of understanding the problems these industries
        face, I am prepared to solve problems in any industry by using the power
        of code! Therefore, I would be happy to work on technology that directly
        impacts and improves people's lives.

        Aside from coding, I enjoy various activities across the internet in my
        free time. I enjoy playing video games in a variety of genres or viewing
        the artistic storytelling of anime(japanese animation). Additionally,
        exploring the new iteration of the internet, web3, has become a recent
        interest of mine. In relation to web3/cryptocurrency, investing and
        trading in stocks or cryptocurrencies is an active hobby I have
        participated in since my college years. I try to

        assets.
